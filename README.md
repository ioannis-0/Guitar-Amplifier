For this project Ioannis and Daniel work together as a team to create a guitar amplifier as we learnt how to use an open source software called KiCad to help create a PCB that we can use to connect to an electric guitar to increase the output volume of the guitar.



For a detail timeline and understanding of the project you can vist here:
