**Personal Project: Guitar Amplifer**
For this project Ioannis and Daniel work together as a team to create a guitar amplifier as we learnt how to use an open source software called KiCad to help create a PCB that we can use to connect to an electric guitar to increase the output volume of the guitar.

This is the KiCad file for the PCB: https://github.com/ioannis-0/Guitar-Amplifier/tree/main/Final%20personal%20project
