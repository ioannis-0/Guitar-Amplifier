### **Personal Project: Guitar Amplifer**
For this project Ioannis and Daniel work together as a team to create a guitar amplifier as we learnt how to use an open source software called KiCad to help create a PCB that we can use to connect to an electric guitar to increase the output volume of the guitar.

This project is made up of two phases with the first one being the creation of the PCB and the second being the testing phase.

**Creation of the PCB:** We have created the PCB of the guitar amplifier on KiCad as it took us around three weeks to make. During this period we ran into a few problems specifically with the types of components we were considering to use. As the components of an operational amplifier, power barrel connector, audio jack and potentiometer were the main issues that arise. But eventually we were able to find compatible components that we could use on our PCB. As the components we used for these main issues are:

Operational amplifier =

Power barrel connector = 

Audio jack = 

Potentiometer = 

**Testing:** We decided to test the PCB on an electric guitar which is the squier sonic stratocaster. As the testing we conducted on this electric guitar was a success as we were able to increase the volume output of the guitar using the PCB we had created.

This is the KiCad file for the PCB:
